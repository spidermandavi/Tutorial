<h1>Final-Rank-Elite Payout Rules</h1>

<h2>1. Leader Cut</h2>
<p>The leader keeps <strong>20%</strong> of each tournament prize. The remaining 80% is split among the players.</p>

<h2>2. Tournament Types</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ChessMood</strong> – monthly tournaments, prize depends on normal/December rules</li>
<li><strong>Streamers</strong> – monthly tournaments with fixed prize table</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Top Player Tiers</h2>
<p>The remaining prize pool is split into three tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top 20 → 50% of player pool</li>
<li>Next 30 → 30% of player pool</li>
<li>Next 50 → 20% of player pool</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Dynamic Adjustment</h2>
<p>If fewer than 100 players participate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last tier (51–100) is split as if 50 players exist; leftover goes to the leader.</li>
<li>If ≥100 participants, all tiers are fully distributed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Net Wins & Debt Carryover</h2>
<p>Each player earns money only for <strong>net positive wins</strong> per tournament type. Draws do not count. Negative netWins are carried over until the player first becomes positive.</p>

<h2>6. Win Rate Tiebreaker</h2>
<p>Players with the same score in a tier are compared by win rate (wins / (wins + losses)), ignoring draws.</p>

<h2>7. Reset / Liquidation</h2>
<p>The admin can reset a player’s earnings for a specific type, leaving their historical stats intact. This is used to pay out players.</p>

<h2>8. Example: 60 Players, $1000 Prize</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Tier</th><th>Participants</th><th>Tier $</th><th>Payout Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>Top 20</td><td>20</td><td>$400</td><td>Distributed proportionally by score/weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>Next 30</td><td>30</td><td>$240</td><td>Distributed proportionally by score/weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>Next 50</td><td>10</td><td>$160</td><td>Each player gets $160 ÷ 50 = $3.20; leftover $128 goes to leader</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>9. Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Calculations are done separately for ChessMood and Streamers tournaments.</li>
<li>History of netWins, scores, and rankings is always kept.</li>
<li>Leaderboard shows Rank, Net Wins, Win Rate, Earnings per type, Total Earnings.</li>
</ul>
