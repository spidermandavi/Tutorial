<h1>Final-Rank-Elite Payout Rules</h1>

<h2>1. Leader Cut</h2>
<p>The leader keeps <strong>20%</strong> of each tournament prize. The remaining 80% is split among players.</p>

<h2>2. Tournament Types</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ChessMood</strong> – monthly tournaments</li>
<li><strong>Streamers</strong> – monthly tournaments</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Top Player Tiers</h2>
<p>The 80% player pool is split into three tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top 20 → 50% of player pool</li>
<li>Next 30 → 30% of player pool</li>
<li>Next 50 → 20% of player pool</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Eligibility</h2>
<p>To receive payout from a tournament, a player must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play at least 10 games (wins + losses + draws)</li>
<li>Have a win rate ≥ 20% (wins / (wins + losses); draws ignored)</li>
<li>Not have had their earnings manually cleared</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Score-Based Payout</h2>
<p>Earnings are distributed proportionally to each player's score (points) within their tier.  
If a player is ineligible, their share is redistributed inside their bracket.  
If there are fewer than 100 participants, missing slots go to the leader.</p>

<h2>6. Minimum Payout</h2>
<p>Players must accumulate at least 5€ before receiving payment. Amounts below this remain recorded and accumulate for future tournaments.</p>

<h2>7. Transaction Fees</h2>
<p>Transaction fees apply and are deducted from payouts. The site does not calculate fees automatically.</p>

<h2>8. Payment Methods</h2>
<p>Payments are made via PayPal. Other methods may be possible but are not guaranteed. Some countries may not be eligible.</p>
